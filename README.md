# Next Steps

Given the short time to create this app here is the following features and enhancements i would do:

1. Styling: Enhance the current experience aligning with the company design team adapting the headless ui to follow proper guidelines;
2. Customize 404 and error boundaries styles;
3. Discuss modularization and next steps of this PoC, wether we should separate the code by features or specific domains;
4. Create an e2e test covering the major features without mocking any request.
